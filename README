                             Casio Prizm PNG viewer
===============================================================================
This  is a PNG viewer for the Casio Prizm. It uses Libpng (which is paired with
zlib)  to  decompress a PNG file. When you load a png file it is  resampled  to
fill the screen but aspect ratio is preserved. As of now a simple bilinear fil-
tering is used but if there is interest I may replace it with something better.

The version you downloaded  is version 1.1. Note  that there is always the pos-
sibility  for a new version, so if you noticed that I posted in the PNG  viewer
thread see what I posted, there may be an update.

                           How to use the PNG viewer
===============================================================================
You will see a file browser on startup use the arrow pad to select a file. Then
press either F1 or EXE to select the PNG file. Press any key except menu (which
actually takes you to the menu) to go back to the file browser.

                                 Notes and tips
===============================================================================
Since  the  Casio  Prizm  does  not  have  lots  of  flash memory run Pngout or
pngwolf-zopfli on the images before putting them on your calculator.

I  have  included  instructions  on  how  to  compile  Libpng  and  Zlib  here:
https://github.com/ComputerNerd/Casio-ImageView/blob/master/Compile%20Libpng
Following  these  instructions gets you a libraries (Libpng and Zlib) that  you
could link against your add-in.

If  you want to use a PNG in an add-in a good option would be to make a 16bit 1
channel  image containing RGB565 data. Doing so introduces additional  overhead
with  no benefit so instead it would be better to use Zlib directly with a sim-
pler  image  format. For example uint32_t width,uint32_t height,  deflate  com-
pressed sequential RGB565 data created by zlib's deflate() function. But if you
feel  comfortable with PNG that is an option. Also you can store the PNGs as  a
const array so that it does not need to be a file. Note that LZMA works well on
the  Casio Prizm and gets a better compression ratio. Try that in favor of Zlib
first.

The  purpose of this program is simply to show off how capable the Casio  Prizm
is. The PNG image format is well known and I think some people wrongly perceive
it  as a very ram intensive thing to decode. Libpng can output a row at a  time
or N amount of rows. When width!=384 or if height>=216 then the image is scaled
Only enough  ram to hold 2 rows are needed which is 6*width bytes of ram. I use
bilinear scaling that is why two rows are needed to be read. After the code in-
terpolates  the  pixels the resulting pixel is converted to RGB565 and sent  to
VRAM.  When the width==384 and height<=216 a buffer is created and the image is
read all at once then simply converted to RGB565 and send to VRAM.
