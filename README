Casio prizm PNG viewer
=============================================
This is a png viewer for the casio prizm.
It uses libpng (which is paired with zlib) to decompress a PNG file.
When you load a png file it is resampled to fill the screen but aspect ratio is preserved.
As of now a simple bilinear filtering is used
but if there is intrest I may replace it with something better.

The version you downloaded is version 1.0
It is likely that there will be versions
so if you notice that I post in the thread
see what I put it may be an update.

============================================
Controls
============================================
You will see a file browser on startup use the arrow pad to select a file.
Then press either F1 or EXE to select the PNG file.
Press any key except menu (which actully takes you to the menu)
to go back to the file browser.
